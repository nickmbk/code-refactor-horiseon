# Code Refactor for Horiseon

## Description

Horiseon created their website, but required it to be more compliant with search engine optimization (seo) rules so that poeple searching for seo services will find their website before any others.

The code for their website needed refactoring to comply with seo, such as using semantic elements and adding alt attributes to images.

CSS was also minimalized to feature less code, having several classes that did the same thing, which were then consolidated into single classes.

The site is now more seo friendly and will be higher in the search results when potential clients are looking for seo services.

I have learnt what contributes to search engine results when working with seo and that condensing the code in CSS will allow the page to load faster as the browser doesn't have to go through so much code.
